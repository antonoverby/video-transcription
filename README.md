# Video Transcription
Uses moviepy to take MP4 video and create WAV file from video's audio. WAV file is then processed by the speech_recognition library to create a transcription.txt file. There is a helper script to download YouTube videos to test.

## Notes:
- Currently only tested with MP4 and WAV formats
- audio.wav file will be produced as byproduct 
- 2:14 minute long sample video takes 35 s to process
